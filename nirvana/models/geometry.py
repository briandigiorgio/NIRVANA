        The ``rot`` argument should be a float.  If it is an array, the code
        will either fault if ``rot`` cannot be broadcast to match ``x`` and

        element.

        x (array-like):
            Cartesian x coordinates.
        y (array-like):
            Cartesian y coordinates.  Shape must match ``x``, but this is not

def projected_polar(x, y, pa, inc):

    Calculate the in-plane polar coordinates of an inclined plane.

    The position angle, :math:`\phi_0`, is the rotation from the :math:`y=0`
    axis through the :math:`x=0` axis. I.e., :math:`\phi_0 = \pi/2` is along the
    :math:`+x` axis and :math:`\phi_0 = \pi` is along the :math:`-y` axis.

    The inclination, :math:`i`, is the angle of the plane normal with respect to
    the line-of-sight. I.e., :math:`i=0` is a face-on (top-down) view of the
    plane and :math:`i=\pi/2` is an edge-on view.

    The returned coordinates are the projected distance from the :math:`(x,y) =
    (0,0)` and the project azimuth. The projected azimuth, :math:`\theta`, is
    defined to increase in the same direction as :math:`\phi_0`, with
    :math:`\theta = 0` at :math:`\phi_0`.

    '''
    Calculate global asymmetry parameter and map of asymmetry.

    Using Equation 7 from Andersen & Bershady (2007), the symmetry of a galaxy
    is calculated. This is done by reflecting it across the supplied position
    angle (assumed to be the major axis) and the angle perpendicular to that
    (assumed to be the minor axis). The value calculated is essentially a
    normalized error weighted difference between the velocity measurements on
    either side of a reflecting line. 

    The function tries to find the nearest neighbor to a spaxel's reflected
    coordinates. If the distance is too far, the spaxel is masked.

    The returned value is the mean of the sums of all of the normalized
    asymmetries over the whole velocity field for the major and minor axes and
    should scale between 0 and 1, wih 0 being totally symmetrical and 1 being
    totally asymmetrical. The map is the average of the asymmetry maps for the
    major and minor axes.

            units as `args.x`.

            Maximum distance to allow the nearest neighbor finding to look for
            a reflexted spaxel. Any neighbor pairs at a radius larger than this
            will be masked. Must be in the same units as the spatial
